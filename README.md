# Conditional-Statements-20-Questions-
Conditional statements in Python allow the program to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program and can handle decisions that influence how the program runs. The primary conditional statements are if, elif, and else.

1. if statement: This checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
2. elif statement: Short for "else if," it allows you to check multiple conditions.
3. else statement: This executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.
